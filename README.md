**Process**:

1. Successfully designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline leveraging Spotify's API, **AWS S3 storage, and Apache Airflow**. Orchestrated data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to collect **top tracks, albums, and artists** data from Spotify, storing it securely in an S3 bucket for further analysis.

2. Demonstrated proficiency in cloud computing by provisioning and configuring an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host Apache Airflow. Established SSH connectivity to the EC2 instance and installed Airflow, configuring its settings including metadata database connections and authentication. This setup facilitated centralized management and scheduling of data pipeline tasks.

3. Contributed to enhancing the organization's data infrastructure by implementing automated processes for data extraction and management. Leveraged Airflow's capabilities to automate the execution of ETL tasks, enabling efficient processing of Spotify data and providing timely insights for decision-making purposes.
